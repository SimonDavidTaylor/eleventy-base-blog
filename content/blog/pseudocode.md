<h3>Reading List</h3>

Here's the pseudocode I wrote for the reading list task.

<code>
\\ Define object array bookList containing bookTitle (String), bookAuthor (String), and bookRead (Boolean).

\\ READ all objects in bookList

\\ 	LOG string bookTitle + " by " + bookAuthor

\\ 	IF bookRead = True THEN LOG "You have already read " + bookTitle + " by " + bookAuthor

\\ 	ELSE LOG "You still need to read " + bookTitle + " by " + bookAuthor

\\ READ Next object
</code>
